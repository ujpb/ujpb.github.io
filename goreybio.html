									<h2>Biography</h2>
									<p>
										Claire Gorey is a junior at the University of Kansas. She is majoring in Psychology and Applied Behavioral Science and minoring in Statistics. Claire is currently an undergraduate research assistant to both the Depression Laboratory and the Performance Management Laboratory. She has an internship at a facility that assess and treats disruptive professionals and is learning how to administer various neuropsychological tests. Claire is fascinated by the brain and hopes to get into a Ph.D. program that focuses on the biological and genetic vulnerabilities to substance abuse disorders.

									<h2>Q&A</h2>
									<p><em>What sparked your interest in psychology?</em> 
										<br>
										I remember being fairly young and looking up topics in Psychology. Once I got to high school, I was just curious about certain mental disorders and why they developed, but college is when I really discovered that Psychology was definitely the career path for me. I took some courses that were really interesting, and I started reading research articles. I really connected with the material, and I knew no other major would spark my interest like Psychology did.</p>
									<p><em>What led you to this topic?</em>
										<br>
										Katie and I joined a Depression lab, and one of the requirements was to write a literature review. We both wanted to do a topic that was not covered in lab. I was interested in Early Life Stress, and Katie was able to connect it to Depression literature, so we went with it. We thought the neurobiological perspective was the most interesting, so we tackled this topic from the viewpoint. I had not even taken a brain and behavior course, but I learned a lot through out the paper. This is what really took the most time. I wanted to truly understand the material before writing the paper.</p>
									<p><em>Did you have a mentor and how did you get involved with them?</em>
										<br>
										We did not have a mentor for this specific paper. Katie and I wrote this independently. However, what we learned from Tiffany Meites in the lab helped us form this paper.</p>
									<p><em>How long have you been working on this paper? What has the process been like for you?</em>
										<br>
										We worked on the paper for a period of four months. Katie and I met up about 7 times over the course of writing paper. Each of us wrote parts on our own as well. Then, a year after we wrote the paper, we met with one of our professors before submitting it to the journal, just to correct any grammatical or formatting errors. The process has been stressful but definitely worth it. It would have been a lot easier if we asked for feedback early on, but it was definitely a learning experience for us by trying to tackle the whole paper on our own, especially as first semester sophomores.</p>
									<p><em>How was collaborating on a paper with another author?</em>
										<br>
										It was a good experience working with another author because you get their perspective on certain topics. It can help guide you toward a better paper, as the paper comes from the collaboration of two unique perspectives. It was also encouraging to have someone keep you on track and motivated. It was a little difficult in terms of writing style because we did not want our literature review to be choppy. We had to make sure it was cohesive because both of us were writing different parts in the paper and combining it.</p>
