										<h2>AUTHOR BIO: MARC WEINTRAUB</h2>

									<h2>Biography</h2>
									<p>
										Marc Weintraub graduated from UC Berkeley in 2010, majoring in Psychology and Social Welfare. After graduating from Berkeley, he worked at UCLA’s Semel Institute under Dr. Miklowitz. In this lab, he was engaged in a few psychological intervention research projects, including family focused therapy for children at-risk for bipolar disorder and a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for perinatal women with mood disorders. He isnow starting his first year of graduate school at the University of Miami where he will be working towards his PhD in Clinical Psychology. The research he is currently doing in Miami involves a family focused therapy for patients with schizophrenia. He hopes to synthesis his current research with his past experience with mindfulness, and create an intervention for patients with schizophrenia using a family-focused mindfulness model.

									<h2>Q&A</h2>
									<p><em>What sparked your interest in psychology?</em> 
										<br>
										My interest in psychology was first sparked by my interest in the social world in which we live. We are fundamentally social creatures, and those social interactions and systems are critical for our survival and success. Learning more about how we engage with other people was (and still is) a fascinating subject to me. Also, the mysteries of the brain is a topic that drew me to psychology. The brain is a frontier of research that has so much room for exploration, and is an organ that is immensely interesting to me.</p>
									<p><em>What led you to this topic?</em>
										<br>
										I was led to my honors thesis topic by merging two main psychology interests–social systems and mood disorders. While the brain can do so many amazingly wonderful things for us, it can also lead us astray. Psychological disorders are a clear example of this, and I wanted to study how we can help reduce or eliminate the impairments that mental disorders often create. Combining my interests in social and clinical psychology, I studies how romantic partners of people with bipolar disorder can help their significant other, and, also, help themselves stay happy in their relationship.</p>
									<p><em>Did you have a mentor and how did you get involved with them?</em>
										<br>
										My mentor for my thesis was Dr. Dacher Keltner. I first started volunteering in his lab, and after a year of coding couples, laughter, and prosocial emotions, I decided to further my research experience and look into conducting an honors thesis. After consulting with some graduate students (Alex Kogan and Amie Gordon) and Dacher Keltner, we came up with a topic and a hypothesis. From there, the research process took its course.</p>
									<p><em>How long have you been working on this paper? What has the process been like for you?</em>
										<br>
										I’ve been working on this project for about 1-1.5 years. The process of compiling the data, analyzing the data, and writing up the report was about an 8 month process. Then, the editing and publishing process took another 4 or 6 months.</p>
									<p><em>What advice do you have for students who would like to publish in the future?</em>
										<br>
										For future or potential thesis-writers, I’d recommend a nice dose of patience and a general expectation that something will go awry. Don’t let those long days/nights throw you off course. Writing a thesis is a great experience, and will give you a lot of insight into the world of research. I’m glad that I decided to write a thesis, and certainly encourage others to give it a go.</p>
