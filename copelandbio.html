									<h2>Biography</h2>
									<p>
										Katherine Copeland, was born in the small town of Buffalo, Wyoming and moved to Allen, Texas when she was nine years old. She was always motivated to do something big with her life and knew that college was the only path for her. She is currently a senior undergraduate student at the University of Kansas, double majoring in Psychology and Applied Behavioral Science. She works as a preschool teacher at La Petite Academy, a research assistant in a clinical psychology lab under Dr. Rick Ingram, and volunteers as a big sister with Big Brothers Big Sisters. She loves working with children and hopes to go into the clinical child psychology profession.
									</p>

									<h2>Q&A</h2>
									<p><em>What sparked your interest in psychology?</em> 
										<br>
										As cliché as it sounds, when I was in high school I was always that friend that everyone would come to with their problems and I ended up being a kind of therapist for all my friends. So when I came to college I took an intro to psych class out of curiosity and I realized that it was so much more than just listening to people. I fell in love with all the different concepts and the research looking at things I didn’t think could even be studied. After taking the intro class I started taking more classes and eventually decided to major in it.</p>
									<p><em>What led you to this topic?</em>
										<br>
										We joined a clinical psychology research lab spring of last year and one of the requirements was to write a literature review. Claire and I had just met and decided to be partners since we didn’t know anyone else in the lab. We wanted to do something that we hadn’t already read a lot about, and since I was interested in children we started looking into early life stressors like abuse and their impact on depression. We were a little overambitious in trying to look at the neurobiological perspective since neither of us had studied very much in that area before, but it ended up being a very interesting topic and it taught us both a lot.</p>
									<p><em>How long have you been working on this paper? What has the process been like for you?</em>
										<br>
										Claire and I worked on this paper over a period of about 4 months, meeting up several times over that period. We split up the paper into sections and would each write one section and then come together to discuss it. Making the paper cohesive was one of the hardest parts because we have such different writing styles and we were trying to fit together the parts that each of us wrote. About a year later we decided to turn it in to be considered for this journal, and we had a professor in the area look it over to see if she had any suggestions. Then we worked with the editors to fix a few minor things once it was accepted. It was a very long process, and it was definitely very exhausting, but it was all worth it in the end.</p>
									<p><em>How was collaborating on a paper with another author?</em>
										<br>
										Working on this paper with Claire has been an interesting experience to say the least. It is always nerve racking to work in pairs when you don’t know the other person because there is always that fear that you will have to pull their weight too. But with Claire things ended up working out really well. She was just as driven as I was and we were both willing to put in all it took, and more, to come up with a good product. I really enjoyed working with Claire because she has a lot of great insight that I never would have thought of. It was also nice to be able to play on each of our strengths to make up for the other’s weaknesses. The hardest part for us was trying to find time to get together since we are both double major’s with internships and jobs outside of school.</p>
