She is interested in how psychology intersects with various facets of identity such as gender, race, and disability, specifically in regards to studies of mental illnesses. Additionally, her interests in media have led her to develop a curiosity for how the portrayals of certain mental illnesses are structured in film and television and whether there is a connection/disparity to individuals with mental illnesses in actual society. Jenny also hopes to study how these perceptions vary and possibly even interconnected at the local, national, and global levels, an interest that stems from her love of travel and culture. As a proud Korean-American, Jenny hopes to utilize languages (she is currently studying Korean, French, and Spanish at UC Berkeley) to bridge cultural gaps and foster dialogues that appreciate rather than condemn diversity. Outside of UJPB, Jenny is an editor at the Berkeley Undergraduate Journal, an operations committee member at BARE Magazine and an on-campus advocacy committee member at Confi at Cal. In her free time, Jenny loves spending time with her friends, exploring restaurants in Berkeley, and volunteering at Berkeley Humane, a local animal shelter.</font></h4>
