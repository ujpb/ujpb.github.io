									<h1>Sasha Sommerfeldt | University of Minnesota</h1>

										Sasha Sommerfeldt graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Philosophy from the University of Minnesota in May 2012. She currently holds a full-time position in neuroimaging in the Brain and Behavioral Processes Laboratory of Dr. Monica Luciana at the University of Minnesota, and also works with children and adolescents receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview.

									<h1>Thao Nguyen | Claremont Graduate University</h1>
									<p>
										I graduated from UCSD Spring 2013 (Psychology, B.S., cum laude) and started my first year of graduate school in the Fall. I currently study Cognitive Psychology at Claremont Graduate University and am researching face recognition memory and prospective memory. My interest in psychology began in high school when my teacher showed us a scene between Jim and Dwight from The Office as an example of Pavlovian Conditioning. After some psychology courses in college, I became fascinated with the brain and human cognition. It is partly due to my terrible memory that I decided to focus my research on memory. When I have the chance, I would like to study some of my other interests as well, which include bilingualism and the intersection between language and music.

									<h1>Sydney Krueger | Princeton University</h1>
									<p>
										Sydney is currently finishing her senior year at Princeton University where she is majoring in Psychology and Neuroscience. Her research interests include aging, working memory, learning, attention, and exercise. She first became interested in cognitive aging after she spent a summer researching neurogenetics and Parkinson’s disease at the National Institutes of Health. While at Princeton, Sydney has worked as an undergraduate research assistant in the Human Working Memory Lab with advisor, Andrew Conway. She wrote her senior thesis on the effects of a pedometer intervention on cognitive functioning in a group of older adults. She is particularly interested in applying psychology or neuroscience to develop products that improve health and enjoyment and plans to attend graduate school for Psychology or Cognitive Neuroscience.

									<h1>Shevantika Nanda | University of St Andrews</h1>
									<p>
										I was first introduced to psychology in high school and I loved it from day one! While studying for my undergraduate degree in psychology at the University of St Andrews, I was exposed to various fields of the subject. I have been fortunate enough to work with some of the most influential researchers within the department while doing my three research internships in Perception, cognitive and social psychology. I am interested in a number of areas specifically, face perception and human attraction, neuropsychology and cross-cultural psychology After completing my degree, I returned to India and have been at a hospital with a neuropsychologist. I am currently in the process of applying for my masters degree and hope to be able to get back to studying later this year.
