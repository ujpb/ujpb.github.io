										<h3> <b>NOTE: If you have submitted an article to editorial@ujpb.org within the last 3 months please RESEND your submission to <a href="mailto:ujpbsubmissions@gmail.com" target="_blank">ujpbsubmissions@gmail.com</a> due to a technical glitch.</b> </h3>

										We are now accepting applications for the 10th edition of the Undergraduate Journal of Psychology--to be published in Spring 2017! Submissions are due by October 15, 2016.
									</p>

									<p>
										UJPB accepts and reviews submissions from all psychology-related fields, including psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, and linguistics, as long as the papers are the original work of undergraduate students.  This includes senior honors theses (note word count limit), course term papers, independent research projects, literature reviews, and all other excellent undergraduate research.  Please ensure that all papers submitted make original arguments, do not report hypothetical studies, and are of general interest to the psychology community.  Multiple submissions from the same authors are welcomed.
									</p>

									<p>
										<span style="color: #ff6600;">
											<strong>
												Please read the submission requirements here for important details about pre-publication screening, conflicts of interest, etc, BEFORE following the link at the bottom of the page to submit your article.
											</strong>

									</p>

									<h1>Requirements For All Submissions</h1>
									<p>
										Publishing a scientific manuscript brings you into a conversation happening between many members of the scientific community throughout the world everyday.  Everyone has a unique human perspective to share in this conversation, and together we aim to understand and predict the human and non-human world.  This is science.  UJPB encourages you to join this conversation by publishing clear, inspiring, and accessible scientific prose.  As you work on your submissions, also consider that you are writing to welcome your peers, and people of all ages and backgrounds to join the conversation as well.  The following guidelines are here to give you a sense of what we look for in a manuscript, and will help you decide the way(s) you want to join the conversation by submitting one of the three possible article types.
									</p>

									<h1>The Submission Process</h1>
									<p>
										Your submitted article will go through a three step process from submission to acceptance. First, all manuscripts get prescreened for the most basic writing competency, and to make sure it answers all the necessary questions for an APA-style research article and that it meets all our requirements for the type of article (see below). Second, we anonymously review the manuscripts and select articles for possible publication. Third, we exchange feedback with the authors, and for the selected articles, if we are able to agree on a final draft, we will make the final decision whether to publish your paper. All accepted papers will be published in print as well as online.
									</p>

									<h1>Copyright</h1>
									<p>
										Contributions will be considered for publication with the understanding that they are first contributing to the <em>Undergraduate Journal of Psychology at Berkeley</em> and have not been previously published elsewhere.
									</p>
									<p>
										Authors retain copyright over their work, but all articles are published here under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a>.
									</p>

									<h1>Conflict of Interest</h1>
									<p>
										Every time you submit an article to UJPB (or any scientific journal) you are required to declare whether you have a conflict of interest.  Make sure you answer these questions now, before you submit your paper! Individuals who had significant roles in the design, analysis, conduct, or reporting of any research performed (or to be performed) must disclose whether or not they have a conflict of interest associated with the subject matter of the submission.
									</p>
									<p>
										Conflict of interest does not necessarily disqualify a submission and reporting all conflicts is mandatory.  Keep this in mind when you fill out our submission form.
									</p>

									<h1>The 3 Types of Articles at UJPB</h1>
									<h1>Stepping Stones</h1>
									<p>
										Stepping Stones are articles written for people who are not (yet?) scientists and do not necessarily aspire to do research.  These articles summarize an interesting area of research, an ongoing debate, or a single published scientific article. You will find that to translate scientific concepts into something a lay reader will understand will teach you a lot about what you really do and do not know. This is perhaps the single best way to learn your science well, and to show others the beauty of what you study.

									</p>

									<h1>Original Research</h1>
									<p>
										An original research article describes a novel study or series of studies that you have performed, which investigate a specific hypothesis.
									</p>
									<p>

										</i>
									</p>

									<h1>Literature Review Articles</h1>
									<p>
										A review article consolidates research on a specific topic and presents the bigger picture of what has been accomplished and where this particular field of research is headed.  If new findings are reported within the context of a literature review, they should not include all of the detailed methods and analyses.  Ideally, you should submit new findings for publications as an original research article, and only provide a summary of yours and other studies within a review article.  This is because Review Articles are written to give readers a sense of the broader scope of some part of the scientific literature, reveal loose ends in the research, and provoke new questions to be researched, rather than to rehash a particular study or opinion.
